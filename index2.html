				<p>QuickCheck is a Nigerian Fintech company that aims to provide banking services to the underserved. Built by people who work towards solving real-world problems, we found out that a large portion of the Nigerian population has no access to proper banking services. We are filling this gap every day, one Nigerian at a time.

					We want to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses and also assist individuals with emergency needs in the form of medical bills, utility bills, family emergencies, and much more. We provide instant credit that allows you to take care of these pressing needs.

					QuickCheck is an automated lending service focused on increasing access to credit for individual borrowers in Nigeria.

Loan decisions are provided within a few days and if approved, the applicant receives funds within 5 minutes. The loans are delivered via a bank account transfer, with lending decisions provided almost instantly. The usual amount for new borrowers is N10k

Loans from moneylenders are designed to be short term loans that are designed to tide you over to the next payday. It is best for anyone looking for an unsecured personal consumer loan, students and individual’s ineligible for typical bank loans due to thin credit files.
